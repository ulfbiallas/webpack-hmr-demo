# Hot Module Replacement Demo

When saving changed code, Hot Module Replacement (HMR) updates the app in the browser automatically.

To try this demo run

    npm run server

and a webpack-dev-server will be started on port 3000.
When you change the `index.js`, the app in the browser will update automatically.

To see changes on the `index.html`, you need to reload the page manually!
